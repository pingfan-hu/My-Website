Hi! My name is Pingfan Hu. I am a PhD student and researcher at George Washington University in the Department of [Engineering Management and Systems Engineering](https://www.emse.seas.gwu.edu) with expertise in systems engineering and data analysis.

My current project is a [smart charging](https://pingfan.quarto.pub/pev-project/) conjoint survey program for electric vehicles.

I am experienced in [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [Python](https://www.python.org) coding, and mainly use [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as working IDE.
