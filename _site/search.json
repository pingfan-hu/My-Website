    "section": "About the Project",
    "text": "About the Project\nThis project aims to build and perform a Conjoint Survey about Smart Charging and V2G (Vehicle to Grid) Charging for PEVs (Plug-in Electric Vehicles). It utilizes the cbctools and logitr R package developed by Professor John Paul Helveston. This project is a combination of Master and PhD levels.\nThe Master-level project is performed as a team with these members: Pingfan Hu, Bharath Ravindra, Sampada Dhakal, and Vedanth Surendra Hegde.\nSmart Charging means to take control of the charging process. To be more specific, the grid provider (aka the utility) controls the charging time and charging speed based on the grid usage and the time window that the users agree to. V2G Charging means to utilize the PEVs as electricity storage and charge back to the grid.\nA previous study of Tarroja and Hittinger (2021) has proved the economic feasibility of both Smart Charging and V2G Charging. This project is therefore a succeeding study of it.\nThe motivation of this study is described as below:\n\nThe adoption of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) is essential for the U.S. to transition to a low-carbon energy system. However, if PEVs are charged during peak electricity demand hours, it could negate their environmental benefits and strain the electrical grid, necessitating expensive upgrades.\nSmart charging is a solution that aims to control the timing of PEV charging according to grid conditions. This strategy is particularly useful for PEV owners who leave their vehicles plugged in for extended periods, allowing the grid to intermittently charge the vehicles when it is most convenient for the grid.\nOn the other hand, V2G charging is to charge the electricity from the PEVs back to the grid. It is a tougher objective compared with smart charging. This objective aims to decrease the amount of stationary power storage of the utility by better using the existing electricity in the PEVs.\nThe challenge lies in convincing PEV owners to participate in smart charging and V2G programs. Concerns about privacy, the need for flexibility in their schedules, and lack of adequate compensation can deter participation.\nFor our program to succeed, there’s a need for a better understanding of social, behavioral, and economic factors influencing PEV owners’ willingness to participate. Different regions, based on their PEV adoption and renewable energy levels, will have varying requirements for such programs.\n\nIn summary, the widespread adoption of PEVs is crucial for a sustainable future, but charging them during peak hours can have drawbacks. Smart charging and V2G could solve this issue, yet its success hinges on understanding and addressing PEV owners’ concerns and varying regional needs."

    "section": "Step 2 - Website Project",
    "text": "Step 2 - Website Project\nThe next step is to create the R project of your website. You can either clone my website repo or make from scratch.\n\n2.1 Clone my repo\nIf you want to clone my repo, proceed to the site, and click on the Code button or Use this template button. Both buttons are in green.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: On the top right of the page, either click on the “Code” or the “Use this template” button to clone my repo as your own.\n\n\n\nIf you are using my template, there are several things I want to explain to ease your understanding:\n\nMy repo is slightly different from the Quarto official blog tutorial, since I prefer to show my personal page as default, and make the other pages, including “About”, “Blogs”, “Projects”, etc. as tabs on the nav bar.\nI used the United theme. This is a free theme made by Bootswatch. There are 25 Bootswatch themes in total, all compatible with Quarto doc. You can access them in the Themes drop-down menu.\nI also used a customized scss file called theme.scss and another css file called styles.css. Both scss and css files are used to define personal page layout settings. The YAML grammar looks like this (You can see the full YAML codes in the _quarto.yml file):\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: [united, theme.scss]\n    css: styles.css\n    backgroundcolor: \"#F8F7F0\"\nNote that there is a backgroundcolor: \"#F8F7F0\" used to set the page background color. The short reason for it being here and not in .scss or .css is that, it gives the best compatibility.\nThe original United theme primary color is orange, but I changed that in my theme.scss file.\nI manually pasted my resume.pdf file to the _site -&gt; contents directory, since I failed to find an automatic solution of creating this file upon knitting.\n\n\n\n2.2 Make from scratch\nIf you want to make one from scratch, please proceed to the official Quarto blog tutorial. For the project set-up, you can follow these steps:\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Launch RStudio and click on “New Project…” from the “File” drop-down menu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Select “New Directory”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Click on “Quarto Blog”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Define the directory name and path, and finally click on “Create Project”\n\n\n\nThe creation of the Quarto Blog R project constructs the skeleton of your personal website. You can now add the contents on to it and make it your own.\n\n\n2.3 Project file structure\nI’ll use my project as an example. If you decided to construct on your own, make sure to have your files and folders sorted in a way that is easy to understand and to reproduce.\nIn my project:\n\nThe _site folder is auto-generated during the knitting process. It stores the HTML pages as well as the PDF files that I want my website to access. Note that the knitting process does not create the PDF files even if they are placed in my project folder. My solution is to manually paste them to the desired locations.\nThe contents folder contains my code, figure, and pdf resources. The folders of blogs and projects are kind of special. They are where the blog and project qmd files are stored, including this one.\nIn the root folder, there are theme files, main tab qmd files, the favicon file, and the _quarto.yml file.\n\n\nHint: You may have noticed that there are several index.qmd files in the project. Index is an important file name. The file with this name will be opened by default. For example, in the root folder, there are several qmd files, but if you open my website homepage, the page you see by default is the one in the index.qmd file.\n\nI recommend you use similar file structure as mine, but if you have a personal preference, feel free to play around and figure out your own style.\n\n\n2.4 Push to GitHub repo\nRemember to push your project to your GitHub repo so that it can be managed and updated in the future. I recommend you using GitHub Desktop. This GitHub repo will also be used in Netlify to deploy your website."

Like I explained, Netlify will assign you with your preferred third-level domain.\n\n3.1 Buy from Namecheap\nIf you decided to buy from Namecheap, you need to create your account and pick your preferred domain name. My domain name costs me about $10 per year, which can be referred as your anchor.\nRemember, although you have full control with your domain on Namecheap, you’ll need to manually set your DNS to link it with your Netlify server, which we’ll cover in Step 4.\n\n\n3.2 Buy from Netlify\nBuying from Netlify is also an option, so that you won’t need to deal with the DNS thing. However, Netlify does not provide a direct page of buying it. As you go through your site creation process, you will have the option to buy your domain."

    "text": "Step 4 - Deploy your website\nCreate your Netlify account using GitHub, and choose to deploy your website from GitHub. Select on your repo and follow the instructions.\nYou can access the Quarto official tutorial on Netlify deployment. Below are several hints from me:\n\nWhen setting your publishing directory, you need to input _site. As I explained in 2.3 Project file structure, this is the default directory for your HTML files. If you defined your own directory, make sure to input the directory name here. The other build settings can be left as they are.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: In “Publish Directory”, you’ll need to fill in _site or your own defined directory name\n\n\n\n\nIf you bought your domain from Namecheap, you’ll need to manually fill in the DNS hostnames. You can access them in Dashboard -&gt; Domains -&gt; Name servers of your Netlify page.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: This is where you can find the DNS hostnames in Netlify\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: This is where you can paste the DNS hostnames in Namecheap\n\n\n\n\nNetlify takes care of SSL/TLS certificate, (aka the HTTPS protocol you can see in the site URLs). It’s a free service by Let’s Encrypt, which is enough for personal use. You can access it in Sites -&gt; Domain management -&gt; SSL/TLS certificate. It’s usually automatically enabled, but it can be manually renewed by clicking on the button on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: HTTPS is taken good care of by Netlify\n\n\n\n\nSince Netlify has direct access to your GitHub repo, each time you push new version to GitHub, your website will be updated automatically. You can also trace the process on your Netlify dashboard. There is no need to type the command of quarto publish netlify in RStudio."

This is the desired version for formr instance.\nRegion - Choose your desired region.\nLinode Plan - Choose “Dedicated CPU” and pick a plan. The formr team recommends 8 CPUs, but I only picked the basic plan.\nLinode Label - Name your server as you wish. I named it as ubuntu-formr.\nAdd Tags - You may add a tag to indicate what this Linode server is for. I created a tag called formr.\nRoot Password - A root user will be generated for you upon server creation. This password is for accessing this root server. However, better create a real user and avoid using root. I’ll cover this later.\nSSH Keys - If you haven’t done so, create an SSH key using your Terminal. Save the key pairs to a safe place. On this page, click on Add An SSH Key and paste the public key here.\nLeave the rest settings as they are.\n\n\n\n1.2 Access online using LISH\nOnce you have created your Linode server, you’ll see it in the “Linodes” section. Click on it to make sure it’s properly running. On top right corner, you’ll see a “Launch LISH Console” button, where LISH is short for Linode Shell. By clicking on it, you’ll open the online shell command terminal.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Click on this button to launch the online shell terminal\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Access locally using Terminal\nHowever, I prefer to use my local Terminal. Follow these steps to access this Linode using your local Terminal:\n\nLaunch your Terminal.\nType in ssh root@your_ip_address, and then input the root password that you created.\nYou’ll see a welcoming message if everything goes properly.\n\nIn fact, you can easily copy the SSH Access command from your Linode dashboard:\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Click on the SSH Access contents to directly copy the command\n\n\n\nNow you have created your Linode server for Ubuntu 22.04 and accessed it with your Terminal!"

    "text": "Project Overview\nThis project is a combination of Master and PhD levels. The Master-level project is performed as a team with these members: Pingfan Hu, Bharath Ravindra, Sampada Dhakal, and Vedanth Surendra Hegde.\nSmart Charging means to control and monitor the PEV charging process. In our project, it contains SMC and V2G. SMC is short for \"Supplier-Managed Charging\". It allows the charging stations to monitor, manage, and even restrict the charging process to optimize energy consumption. V2G is short for \"Vehicle-to-Grid\". It allows bidirectional charging, so that the vehicle can discharge a certain amount of electricity back to the grid to further optimize energy consumption by balancing supply and demand.\nA previous study of Tarroja and Hittinger (2021) has proved the economic feasibility of both SMC and V2G. This project is therefore a succeeding study of it.\nThe motivation of this study is described as below:\n\nThe adoption of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) is essential for the U.S. to transition to a low-carbon energy system. However, if PEVs are charged during peak electricity demand hours, it could negate their environmental benefits and strain the electrical grid, necessitating expensive upgrades.\nSMC is a solution that aims to control the timing of PEV charging according to grid conditions. This strategy is particularly useful for PEV owners who leave their vehicles plugged in for extended periods, allowing the grid to intermittently charge the vehicles when it is most convenient for the grid.\nOn the other hand, V2G is to charge the electricity from the PEVs back to the grid. It is a tougher objective compared with smart charging. This objective aims to decrease the amount of stationary power storage of the utility by better using the existing electricity in the PEVs.\nThe challenge lies in convincing PEV owners to participate in the SMC and V2G programs. Concerns about privacy, the need for flexibility in their schedules, and lack of adequate compensation can deter participation.\nFor our program to succeed, there’s a need for a better understanding of social, behavioral, and economic factors influencing PEV owners’ willingness to participate. Different regions, based on their PEV adoption and renewable energy levels, will have varying requirements for such programs.\n\nIn summary, the widespread adoption of PEVs is crucial for a sustainable future, but charging them during peak hours can have drawbacks. The Smart Charging programs could solve this issue, yet its success hinges on understanding and addressing PEV owners’ concerns and varying regional needs."
