## Welcome to my website!

Hi! My name is Pingfan Hu. I am a PhD student and researcher at George Washington University in the Department of [Engineering Management and Systems Engineering](https://www.emse.seas.gwu.edu).

I have expertise in systems engineering and data analysis. I am working on projects of [electric vehicles](https://pingfan.quarto.pub/pev-project/) and [renewable energies](https://pingfan.quarto.pub/emse-6572-final-project/).

I mainly use [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as working IDE, and I am experienced in [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [Python](https://www.python.org) coding.
