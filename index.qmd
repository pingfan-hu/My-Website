## Welcome to my website!

Hi! My name is Pingfan Hu. I am a PhD student and researcher at George Washington University in the Department of [Engineering Management and Systems Engineering](https://www.emse.seas.gwu.edu) with expertise in systems engineering and data analysis.

I am experienced in [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [Python](https://www.python.org) coding, and mainly use [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as working IDE.

My current project is a [conjoint survey](https://jhelvy.github.io/smartcharging/) for BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) Smart Charging adoption.
